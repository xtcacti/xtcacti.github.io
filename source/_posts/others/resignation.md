## to co-workers say goodbye

Hey you guys,

As you may have already heard, I’m leaving my position and today is my last day.

I wanted to take a moment to let you know how much I’ve enjoyed my time here. It’s been so great working with you and getting to know you. 

I prefer to think of this as “See you later” instead of “Goodbye.” So, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you’d ever like to get in touch.

Wishing you all the best
